# Projects

A **project** in Conduit represents a git repository you work with.

## What is a Project?

- A project is tied to a specific git repository
- Projects contain one or more workspaces
- Each workspace corresponds to a git branch

## Adding Projects

1. Press `Ctrl+N` to open the project picker
2. Press `Ctrl+A` to add a new repository
3. Enter the path to your git repository

## Project Tree

The sidebar displays your projects in a tree structure:

```
Project Name
├── main (workspace)
├── feature-branch (workspace)
└── bugfix (workspace)
```

## Managing Projects

From the sidebar:
- `r` — Add a new repository
- `x` — Archive or remove a project
- `s` — Open settings
